# Navbot Project Status

**Last updated:** 2026-04-20
**Branch:** `navbot-experimental`
**HEAD at update time:** `78c9cfe`
**Firmware version:** `1.3.0` (source); `1.2.0` last-flashed validation freeze
  (see [validation/records/2026-04-13-record.md](validation/records/2026-04-13-record.md)).

This is the single source of truth for project state. It replaces
ad-hoc tracking of Phase C state in session transcripts. Update at the
end of each substantive session.

## Current State

The robot hardware is assembled and validated. First motion test
(120 mm straight drive at 0.05 m/s) succeeded with <1 mm odom error
against physical tape — see
[testing/motion-tests.md](testing/motion-tests.md). INA238 power
monitoring is live on System 1 (Pi rail). Foxglove bridge dashboard is
configured with a default layout committed
([operations/foxglove/README.md](operations/foxglove/README.md)). The
brake firmware experiment was reverted with full forensics committed
([notes/brake-attempt-forensic.md](notes/brake-attempt-forensic.md)).

## Active Work

No active work in-flight as of this update. Next session will begin
from this file's backlog sections.

## Recent Milestones

- **2026-04-20** INA238 driver header updated to cite SBOSA20C and
  document DEVICE_ID rev (commit `90ecee5`). Firmware banner bumped
  to 1.3.0 (commit `abba930`). Docs restructured into semantic
  subdirectories with migrated session knowledge (commit `ddbb9a7`).
  Package/firmware READMEs filled in (commit `78c9cfe`). Ops
  hardening commit `c73a297` added opt-in static-IP stanza in
  setup-pi.sh, RUNBOOK pre-flight safety checklist, and
  power-architecture doc.
- **2026-04-20** INA238 driver fix validated (commit `b309625`).
  False-positive root-caused: zero readings observed earlier were
  because the System 1 battery pack was OFF — driver itself is
  correct.
- **2026-04-20** Discovered Pi 5 USB-C and GPIO 5V OR-together through
  internal diodes (measured 0.94 A through INA238 shunt while Pi on
  USB-C). Documented in [power-architecture.md](power-architecture.md).
- **2026-04-19** Pi static IP `192.168.68.101` set via netplan;
  cloud-init network regen disabled.
- **2026-04-19** Pre-wipe kinematic calibration validated — EXCELLENT,
  no calibration changes needed
  ([validation/records/2026-04-19-pre-wipe-calibration.md](validation/records/2026-04-19-pre-wipe-calibration.md)).
- **2026-04-18** DWB rotation-only diagnosis session — full writeup
  at
  [validation/records/2026-04-18-dwb-rotation-session.md](validation/records/2026-04-18-dwb-rotation-session.md).
- **~2026-04** Pi rebuild (fastcdr ABI mismatch trigger) with 5 silent
  bugs fixed — see [hardware/pi-rebuild.md](hardware/pi-rebuild.md).
- **~2026-04** Brake firmware experiment attempted and reverted
  (commits `dc87008` attempted, `dc07888` archived). Forensic at
  [notes/brake-attempt-forensic.md](notes/brake-attempt-forensic.md).
- **2026-04-13** v1.2.0 validation freeze: 33/33 bench tests passed,
  10.8 h soak with 0 crashes / 0 disconnects / 0 checksum failures
  ([validation/records/2026-04-13-record.md](validation/records/2026-04-13-record.md)).

### Open — High Priority

- [ ] **Active counter-drive firmware** — replaces the ineffective
      regen-brake concept. Unblocks higher-speed motion and rotation
      tests because coast-on at 0.05 m/s is already 17 mm. See
      [notes/brake-attempt-forensic.md](notes/brake-attempt-forensic.md)
      for what was tried and why it failed.
- [ ] **Higher-speed motion test** (0.2–0.3 m/s, 0.3 m drive). Depends
      on counter-drive being good enough to control the coast-on
      envelope at higher speeds.

### Open — Medium Priority

- [ ] **`/base/motor_voltage` rail-scaling "C7 bug"** — firmware fix.
      Topic currently reads ~5.13 V (rail-scaled) rather than true
      battery voltage. Not a rail fault; a firmware arithmetic error.
- [ ] **Firmware `wheel_radius` 0.033f vs URDF 0.0325 alignment** —
      the URDF was corrected to `0.0325 m` (commit `1952f6a`), but
      firmware source still hard-codes `0.033f`. Current ~1.5% odom
      error comes from this mismatch. See
      [hardware/pi-rebuild.md](hardware/pi-rebuild.md) bug #5.
- [ ] **URDF `wheel_offset_y` 0.08 → 0.09** and firmware
      `WHEEL_SEPARATION_M` alignment.
- [ ] **First rotation test** — blocked on counter-drive (open-loop
      rotation at creep speed coasts too far to read usefully).
- [ ] **Second INA238 on motor rail** — for counter-drive current
      monitoring. Placement options (high-side vs low-side) discussed
      in [power-architecture.md](power-architecture.md#future-motor-rail-current-monitoring).

### Open — Lower Priority

- [ ] **IMU integration (MPU-6050)** — ~10 hr. Adds a 6DOF IMU on top
      of the existing L3GD20+LSM303D cluster. Needed for reliable
      Nav2 rotation handling in real environments.
- [ ] **First navigation goal** — blocked on rotation test.
- [ ] **3D model integration** — awaiting CAD files.
- [ ] **NOPASSWD sudo removal** — needs physical keyboard access to
      the Pi to avoid locking out SSH.

## Known Issues / Gotchas

- **Pi USB-C does not isolate from System 1 battery rail.** Internal
  OR-diodes. Measured 0.94 A through INA238 shunt in this exact
  state (2026-04-20). See
  [power-architecture.md](power-architecture.md#important-usb-c-does-not-isolate-pi-from-this-system).
- **`/base/motor_voltage` reads rail-scaled**, not true battery voltage.
- **Nav2 `drive_on_heading` deceleration params are Kilted/Rolling
  only**, not Jazzy. Do not try to re-add them on Jazzy — reverted at
  commit `8cf3319`.
- **CP210x `-110` on control transfer `0x12`** from LiDAR is usually
  System 2 battery undervoltage, not a USB bus fault.
- **INA238 zero readings with driver healthy** → check System 1
  battery pack switch first. Zero readings do not imply a driver bug
  when the pack is OFF. See
  [hardware/ina238.md](hardware/ina238.md#troubleshooting-matrix).
- **`sllidar_node` holds deleted fd when CP2102 re-enumerates** →
  restart bringup; the node does not error out on its own.

## Decisions Log

- **`base_footprint` chosen as primary 2D nav frame** (commit
  `d7aa26c`). SLAM 33 mm offset was the smoking gun. Full rationale:
  [hardware/pi-rebuild.md](hardware/pi-rebuild.md) bug #3.
- **CycloneDDS chosen over FastDDS.** Required 16 MB kernel socket
  buffers (commit `9178451`) — baked into `setup-pi.sh` so future Pi
  rebuilds inherit the tuning.
- **LiDAR filter pipeline: `+Inf` → NaN, 16 m range cap** (commit
  `4565c25`). Per Slamtec guidance.
- **Foxglove bridge as primary dashboard**; `navbot_web` retained
  for the rosbag capture workflow until Foxglove covers that path.
- **Active counter-drive over regenerative brake** for creep-speed
  stop-on-command — regen brake was validated ineffective below a
  coast threshold that sits above our current motion envelope
  ([notes/brake-attempt-forensic.md](notes/brake-attempt-forensic.md)).
- **Firmware version bumps on every experiment-and-revert cycle**, not
  just net functional changes. Established 2026-04 along with the
  1.2.0 → 1.3.0 bump. See [../firmware/makerpi_rp2040_base/README.md](../firmware/makerpi_rp2040_base/README.md#firmware-version-banner).
- **Opt-in static-IP for setup-pi.sh** (`NAVBOT_CONFIGURE_STATIC_IP=1`)
  rather than default-on, so idempotent re-runs on a working Pi do
  not silently change networking.
- **Docs restructure into semantic subdirectories** (not numbered
  prefixes). Abandoned the partial `04-dashboards` / `06-validation`
  numbering experiment.
